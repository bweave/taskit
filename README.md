# Taskit

Oh you know, just another Task app.

### Goals

- build a Rails app that's got a nice interactive UI without using a front end framework, e.g. Angular, React, etc.
- deepen my knowledge of ActionCable
- build a Task app that combines some of my favorite features from Trello and Axosoft, SoloApp, e.g. cards can belong to another card, dynamic schedule built from projects/cards due dates.
- simple deployment via Heroku

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
